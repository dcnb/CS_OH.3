[0:00],Tom Ikeda,So tell me a little bit about what the Japanese community was like in Bellevue during this time. So you're... it was like...,Bellevue
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"We didn't have any special place. We just walked, everything was walking in those days. And we'd go visit our friends, but they were all a distance away. But the Takizakis lived right close to us.",
,Tom Ikeda,"Now, describe where you lived in Bellevue.",
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"Bellevue, right now is where Bellevue parking lot 1s, we lived on that corner. This corner and the parking lot's over on this side. So I think it's First Avenue.",
,Tom Ikeda,So the parking lot to Bell Square? That parking lot?,
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"Uh-huh, yes. Just kitty-corner from the northwest corner.",
,Tom Ikeda,"Okay, northwest...",
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,There was farm there.,Agriculture
[1:00],Tom Ikeda,"That's amazing. Just within a block or so from the current Bellevue Square, which is a large shopping mall.",
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"Yes. Of course, I don't know how far, maybe it was city blocks, I don't know how many. In those days, they didn't have any blocks. Laughs",
,Tom Ikeda,"And during that time, do you know if your parents owned the land, or were they leasing It?",
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"No, we had to lease it. Fortunately, we had a very nice, people that used to lease it to us. And I remember we lived in a log cabin, that was quiet, it's about a mile north of where we lived.",
,Tom Ikeda,So explain that again. You said you lived in a log cabin?,
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"Uh-huh, my brother was, I think, born there at the time. It was about a mile north of where we lived.",
[2:00],Tom Ikeda,"So describe the log cabin for me. How large was it, what did it look like?",
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"It was made out of logs, and they had, I don't know what they had in between, but I remember we were cold because wind would come through those cracks, you know, between the logs.",
,Tom Ikeda,"Now, do you know who made the log cabin?",
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"No, I have no idea.",
,Tom Ikeda,And what kind of farming did your family...,
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"We didn't do much there, but mostly strawberries. I don't know what they did at that time, but after that we moved and went to a better place where Lakeview Is now. Bellevue's richest place right now, we had a better farm there. And that was just before the accident.",Agriculture; Lakeview
,Tom Ikeda,"So when you moved to Lakeview, how large were these farms? How large was your farm?",
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"Oh, I think it was like three acres or something, I don't know. But as a child, not interested in those things. Laughs",
[3:00],Tom Ikeda,"Before we get to the accident, I'm just curious what a typical day was like in Bellevue for you.",
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"It was nice, we were just, you know, no prejudice or anything like that we got along with everybody. We had lots of hakujin neighbors, very nice.",
,Tom Ikeda,"Now, do you remember, if you could think back who some of your best friends were back in these...",
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"I did have very good friends. They used to live, from where we lived, it was about... I don't know how many blocks it would be. But had a girlfriend there and they were very good to us. To this day, I don't know where, she left, they moved to Yakima eventually. I don't know where they are now, but she was my best friend.",
,Tom Ikeda,Do you remember her name?,
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,Evelyn Parrish.,
,Tom Ikeda,And so she was hakujin?,
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,Yeah.,
[4:00],Tom Ikeda,Evelyn Parrish. And what were some of the things that you and Evelyn would do?,
,Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"Oh, there used to be a little tree, I don't know what they call that, you know, small trees where we used to go in there and play house and things like that.",
,Tom Ikeda,So actually inside the tree you would play?,
[4:15],Bernadette Suda Horiuchi,"No, no, around it. Those small trees, they're not those big trees. We used to go in there and play house.",
