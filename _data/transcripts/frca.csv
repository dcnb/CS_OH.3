[0:00],Ruth L. Wett,"Well then were most of the people who came about the time that your parents moved here to Tacoma, were most of them peasants?",
,Father John Cebula,"They were mostly from peasant stock. There opportunities for education in Poland were limited, 20 me of the area that was occupied I can speak of my parents area which was under Russia; the youngster went to school in the morning, in Russian and went to school in the morning and in the afternoon they were allowed to use Polish. The amount of education was limited so the Poles would not be in the position to raise much opposition. to the occupying forces. They were not permitted to/acquire new some cases, to take lands. In fact the occupying country tried the land and turn it over to their favorites, either from Russia and among the Poles that might be supportive of their efforts. The people who came here were looking for a chance primarily to get a place to make a living, of acquire land. They had very little to offer in the way of jobs. In other words they were limited pretty much to finding work they could do with their hands. And so many of them ended up in the mines around Black Diamond, Carbonado and Wilkeson. a place called Fairfax you don't find on the maps any more. Then some more found work in the lumber mills in the tide flats. here in Tacoma. Others went to farming in the Puyallup Valley, those were the days of berry farming, just beginning; and some of them, I'd say were successful and became comfortably fixed on the berry farms.",Mining; Black Diamond; Carbonado; Wilkeson; Agriculture; Puyallup

,Father John Cebula,"Well you can go downtown in the Pacific National Bank, on or 12th? you'll see some pictures of what Tacoma looked like 1870, 1880; you would be surprised how close the woods were to what we call downtown Tacoma now. 1 can remember seeing pictures of groups of Poles that marched in the Fourth of July parade; these parades would be downtown and I guess various countries were represented in parade: they would put on their native costumes--l remember seeing my father carrying a sword, and a number of his countrymen with him. They seemed to be a saloon some where I guess around 24th and Pacific, where they used to congregate that was the hub of their social life, for the single men I suppose, and maybe the married men. But some of these, were probably organized by the National Alliance (which is still active. Originally it was drawn up to keep Poles together. Polish them the opportunity to have some sort of insurance to carry them through the trying periods which you know. I mean other nationalize have the same. 'But I think that the Polish National Alliance may have organized these parade units.",Tacoma;
(4:50),Ruth L. Wett,What kind of community life if any was there among the Poles here in the Tacoma area?,
,Father John Cebula,"Well, there was a lot of community life, I can remember shortly after out parish started here that we would have a weekly card party sponsored by the church. And the hall would be full of people playing mostly Whist. Then once a week there would be a dance in the Polish Hall, we haven't mentioned the Polish Hall but on 30th, reach of the but down Portland Avenue five blocks turn to the right and two blocks to the east you'll find what we call the Polish Hall, the Polish National Alliance, which to be a two-story building when I and the dances would be held upstairs.",
